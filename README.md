# StickBlastPrototype
This game is a prototype of Stick Blast 

Day 1

12.00- 13.15	I reviewed the email I received and played the game to get an idea about it. After gaining some insight, I thought about the core mechanics and decided to start by creating a flowchart.

16.00 		I created the flowchart, but at one point I realized I made a critical mistake. I had planned some of the operations based on the nodes instead of the bars. So, I took some time to review the game and made a new plan, then created a new flowchart.

18.30 		I initially thought of creating a script called PieceGenerator to merge the sticks. However, after a while, I realized that this was a pointless effort and decided that manually merging them would be both easier and more logical. This is because there aren’t too many piece types, and they don’t form in a specific pattern.

21.00		I tried merging them manually for a while, but I soon realized that the pieces don’t quite fit together. I had no idea how to solve it. I thought about it for a bit, but since I was spending too much time on this part, I decided to leave it for later and started thinking about how to solve the grid system in the game.

22.00 		I wondered whether I should follow the nodes, the bars, or my cells. In the end, I decided to use the cells.

24.00		By this time, I managed to achieve the following:

			1) Created three pieces (as placeholders) in the selection area.
			2) Enabled the pieces to be dragged with an offset when clicked.
			3) Implemented a faded preview of the piece during dragging (this will be refined so that the fading only occurs in appropriate locations).
			4) Set up the grid (since I built it based on cells, this part might be completely overhauled later; I started it without fully thinking it through because I was very tired).
			5) Enabled the pieces to snap into place.
01.00		Currently, a piece can only be placed on the grid. I manually merged the sprites of the pieces onto the placeholders and turned off the sprite renderers for the placeholders. I ended my work for today so I could think clearly later.

Day 2

9.30		I reviewed my most recent work and realized that I made some serious mistakes by making poor decisions. Relying on cells turned out to be a very bad choice. I could continue with this approach, but it would significantly complicate the process, or I could rebuild the system from scratch. Fortunately, I believe that some of my solutions will still work for the alternative option. To avoid repeating yesterday's mistakes, I'll take some time to carefully consider how to proceed before moving forward.
